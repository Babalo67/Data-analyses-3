Phone Call Data Analysis
This repository contains scripts and documentation for analyzing phone call data.

Introduction
Phone call data analysis can provide valuable insights into communication patterns, network usage, and user behavior. This project aims to clean, process, and analyze phone call data to extract meaningful information.

Data Cleaning
Overview
Data cleaning is a crucial step in the analysis process. It involves identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and missing values in the dataset to ensure accuracy and reliability in subsequent analyses.

Steps
Importing Data: Load the raw phone call data into a pandas DataFrame.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to understand the structure and content of the dataset. Identify missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Handling Missing Values: Implement strategies to handle missing values, such as imputation or removal.
Standardization: Standardize data formats and values to ensure consistency across the dataset.
Handling Outliers: Identify and address outliers that may skew analysis results.
Data Validation: Validate data integrity and correctness after cleaning operations.
